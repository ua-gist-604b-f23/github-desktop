## Assignment
### Background
So far we've edited our GitHub files directly in the browser, but this is actually a special case.
A more typical workflow for a developer working on an existing project is as follows:

1) Clone a repo (download all the files from a repo to your local computer)
2) Create a branch
3) Make local edits and commit them to the branch
4) Push the local changes to the remote repository
5) Submit `Pull request` for branch to be merged with the master branch.

### Get started with GitHub Desktop
#### 1. Download GitHub Desktop
In order to take on this workflow, you need a `git` client. For this class, I recommend *GitHub Desktop*, which can download
from [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/). 

#### 2. Setup GitHub Desktop with your username/password
Follow the installation and setup instructions at https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop

#### 3. Clone this repository
- Now that you have Github Desktop installed and configured for your account, it is time to clone THIS repository. If you don't see 
the green "Clone" button ![clone_button.png](clone_button.png), click on the `<> Code` tab at the top of this page to get to
this repository's root. Click on the "Clone" button to get the URL of this repository.

- Switch to GitHub Desktop and click on *File* -> *Clone Repository*. It will probably default to your `Documents` folder. 
GitHub Desktop will like to put all your repositories in the same directory so just pick one that makes sense. 
Note that you will need to navigate to this folder from QGIS and other applications later since this is how project files 
and data will be handled for this class.

- Enter the URL from the step above and click "Clone". 

#### 4. Create a new branch
From GitHub Desktop, create a new Branch by clicking `Branch` -> `New Branch`. Give it the name `desktop`. 

#### 5. Take a screen shot of your GitHub Desktop
Take a screen shot of your GitHub Desktop showing this Repository (`1-5-github-desktop`) and the Current Branch as `desktop`.

#### 6. Copy screen shot to this branch, locally.
In GitHub Desktop you should see a link to `open this repository` -- That will open the folder where this repository is checked out 
on your local computer. Copy the screenshot you made to this folder.
